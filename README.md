Description of __CODE__:

  -We have developed code using python that is run on the microbit to play different sounds and tone in various sequences.
  
  __SENSORS and CHARACTERS USED__:

  - The python code we have develpoed uses the following to be carried out:
  
    1) Processor
    
    2) LED lights
    
    3) USB connector
    
    4) Wire
    
    5) Output audio (speaker or heaphones)

__CODE__ and test:
  - to test the code to see if it worked properly we used a home-made headphone system where we used two wires and placed them on the jack of the headphones cable and then connected it to the ground and 0 ports on the microbit which allowed us to hear the different tones that we programmed it to produce.
  - we the coppied the code from the python writing website onto the microbit to run through its programme.
